# User Testing Report – Not-Notion Task Manager

**What the App Does**

- This is a basic task management app that lets you:
- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Set task priorities (High, Medium, Low)
- Add dates to tasks
- Mark tasks as done or not done
- View tasks in different ways (All, Today, Upcoming, High Priority, Completed)

# Nawal’s Experience Using the App

**Design and Layout**

- The app has two panels: navigation on the left, tasks on the right
- Blue color theme makes it look consistent
- Each task shows key info: name, date, description, and priority
- Priority levels use colors: red (High), orange (Medium), blue (Low)

**Using the App**

- It's easy to add tasks with the “Add Task” button
- You can check off tasks when done
- Each task has Edit and Delete buttons
- When a task is done, the name is crossed out (strikethrough)

**Navigation**

- You can quickly switch views from the sidebar
- The current view is clearly shown at the top
- There's a summary at the bottom showing total and completed tasks

**Issues and Suggestions**

- The “Add Task” form only checks if the name is filled in—it could check more
- The Add button is a bit small and tucked in the corner
- There’s no search bar to quickly find tasks
- You can't filter by custom rules (only by the default views)
- You can't manually sort tasks—they're auto-sorted by date and priority
- No tags or categories to organize tasks better

**Extra Feedback from Nawal**

- The label “Name” should say “Task Name” for clarity
- The design could look more polished and professional
- She likes the ability to check off tasks and see them crossed out
- The priority system is simple and useful
