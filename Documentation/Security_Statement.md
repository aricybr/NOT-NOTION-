# SECURITY STATEMENT

NOT NOTION is a python based application that focuses on the user and simplicity. There is an importance in maintaining basic security practices throughout the development process.

## Data Security
- All task data will be stored on the user's machine
- All the data saved will be in a structured format with basic input to prevent injection attacks.

## Application Security
- Input validation will be implemented to prevent attacks such as buffer overflows
- Error handling will be implemented
- The application will operate only with minimum required permissions on the user's system
- The dependencies used will be minimized as uch as possible and be kept updated to minimize vulnerability exposure

## Security Limitations
- NOT Notion has not undergone any professional security testing or auditing as it is a class project
- The application is not designed to handle sensitive information
- No encryption is implemented on stored data
- The saved data is reliant on the user's local system security

## Recommended Security Practices
- Only install the application on secured devices
- Do not add sensitive information when making task descriptions on the application
- Make sure the device you are using has an updated antivirus and firewall protection
- Do not use the application for managing sensitive business or personal information, this application was created for basic day to day activities. If you choose to use personal information, do so at your own risk.
