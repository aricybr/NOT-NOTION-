# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY STATEMENT

NOT NOTION is a standalone python application that has been developed for a software engineering class. Built using Python with Tkinter as the GUI framework, the applications purpose ia to provide a convinient, user friendly and free method to organize and track daily tasks without any unneccessary complexity.
<br>

The application focuses on delievring task management functionality with a clean and easy to use interface.

With this local first approach,users can access their task information without internet conncectivity. No need to worry about your productivity flow being threatned is the internet goes out. 
<br> 

We prioritize simplicity and usability while maintaining code quality and structure. As a class project, NOT NOTION is an implementation of software engineering concepts (user interface development, system design). Although, it is limited in scope, the aim of the application is to deliver meaningful fucntionality that addresses real user needs through thoughtfful design and implementation choices.
