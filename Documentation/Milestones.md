#  Not-Notion: Task Management Application
**Core Concept**

- Simple, intuitive task management application built with Python and Tkinter
- Focus on essential functionality without unnecessary complexity

**Key Features**

- Task tracking (add, edit, delete tasks)
- Priority setting (high, medium, low)
- Task completion marking
- Basic reporting/statistics
- GUI-first approach with Tkinter interface
- Secure data storage and user authentication

**Development Focus**

- User-friendly interface that's easy to navigate
  Reliable data persistence
- Smooth performance
- User story development
- Clean, readable code structure

**Testing & Refinement**

- Security testing and vulnerability assessment
- User acceptance testing
- Bug fixing 
- Documentation completion

# SPRINT GOALS
**SPRINT 1**

- Getting the foundation set up
- Having the basics such as a timeline, scope statement etc done

**SPRINT 2**

- Have a basic design set up with UML, Problem frame and level 0 and 1 diagrams

**SPRINT 3**

- Get a basic GUI setup

**SPRINT 4 – DFD & UML Revisions/Updating**

- Fix the DFD (Evan):
- Revise the current DFD into a proper Level 0 format:
- One main process (project name).
- All external entities clearly shown and connected.

**Clean Up UML Diagrams:**

- Ensure arrows only show inheritance.
- Use class attributes for inclusion/relationships instead of arrows.
- Clearly define class names, attributes, and methods.

**SPRINT 5 – continue Code and Design Sync**

- Sync codebase with the updated UML design.
- Ensure each class in UML exists in code with accurate structure and relationships.

**SPRINT 6 – User Testing**
- Conduct user testing sessions
- Collect feedback and report usability issues
- Make final usability adjustments based on feedback

**SPRINT 7 – Final Integration Prep**

- Implement code testing (Jawaria)
- Finish coding (Mana)
- Finalize design structure (Evan)
- Complete user manual (Mana)
- Finish documentation (Lateefat)

  # User Stories

**Authentication**

- As a user, I want to securely log in to the application so that my tasks remain private
- As an administrator, I want password requirements enforced so that user accounts remain secure

**Task Management**

- As a user, I want to create new tasks with titles and descriptions so I can track what needs to be done
- As a user, I want to set priorities on tasks so I can focus on what's important
- As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete so I can track my progress
- As a user, I want to delete tasks that are no longer relevant

**Data Management**

- As a user, I want my data to be securely stored so unauthorized users cannot access it
- As a user, I want my task data to persist between sessions so I don't lose my task list

**Reporting**
- As a user, I want to see basic statistics about my tasks so I can track my productivity
- As a user, I want to filter tasks by status or priority so I can focus on specific subsets
